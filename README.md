# Next.js 14 + React Query example

This project is merely an example of how to use [React Query](https://tanstack.com/) with [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) and Server Components.

The example here is based on React Query's [Advanced Server Rendering](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/advanced-ssr) docs. We encourage to read that documentation for further explanation and use cases.

### Usage

As with any Next.js app, just run:

```
npm run dev
```
